          <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>

          <p>
            How I stay committed to learning I like to think of myself as a
            lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
            to create simple projects using what I learned or work new
            techniques into existing projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
            was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
          </p>

          <h3>How I got started</h3>
          <p>
            I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
            would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
            session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
            also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
          </p>
          <p>
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
            my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
            motivated.
